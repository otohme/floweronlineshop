Flower shop website; Front &amp; Back end.
The proposed system allows Customers to do several things on the website, such as placing an order, viewing products and exploring blogs. They will also have a contact option where they can reach the website owner for further details; in addition to some other features on the website that would be discussed later in the report. 

Regarding the back-end, the admin can control the whole flow of the purchasing process and keep track of the whole information of the clientsâ€™ products, allows clients to purchase those products by filling a personal form on an order page. Moreover, it allows admins to control the whole flow of the purchasing process, manage products and categories. 

The flowers shop website, Flourish, was developed using Visual studio code in: PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I also used SQLite as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform to store and retrieve user data.
